One thing I stumbled upon in my first job as a working student was the term **foo bar**. My mentor back then told me it was a fantasy word used as input value without meaning. Just recently I found out that wasn't true.

In fact the usage he talked about was correct. But foo bar has it's origins in military and stands for: _**fu**cked **u**p **b**eyond **a**ll **r**ecognition_!

Once you get tired of always using the same take a look at [**this list of acronyms for inspiration**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_slang_terms#FUBAR). My favourite: _**f**ucking **r**idiculous **e**ating **d**evice_.

Have fun!
