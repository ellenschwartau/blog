        <p>
          Last week, we had the pleasure of hosting Joblift for our Tech x Orbit
          meetup series. They shared their journey of implementing GitOps in
          their infrastructure, which manages over 100 microservices!
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">What is GitOps?</h3>
        <p>
          GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment for cloud native
          applications. It focuses on a developer-centric experience when
          operating infrastructure, by using tools developers are already
          familiar with, including Git and Continuous Deployment tools.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">The Core Principles</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>The entire system is described declaratively</li>
          <li>The canonical desired system state is versioned in Git</li>
          <li>Approved changes can be automatically applied to the system</li>
          <li>Software agents ensure correctness and alert on divergence</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Benefits of GitOps</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Increased productivity</li>
          <li>Enhanced developer experience</li>
          <li>Improved stability</li>
          <li>Higher reliability</li>
          <li>Consistency and standardization</li>
          <li>Strong security guarantees</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-6 mb-3">Tools & Implementation</h3>
        <p>Joblift uses several tools to implement their GitOps workflow:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Flux CD for continuous deployment</li>
          <li>Kubernetes as the container orchestration platform</li>
          <li>ArgoCD for GitOps operations</li>
          <li>Helm for package management</li>
        </ul>

            * WASP stands for Write, Apply, Ship, and Pray - a humorous take on
