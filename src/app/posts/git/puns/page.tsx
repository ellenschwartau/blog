          I love pun of words. Especially the bad ones. In my day to day life I
          use <strong>git</strong> as version control and find myself laughing
          at some of my <strong>typos</strong>. I started collecting the ones
          that <strong>made me giggle</strong>. By chance it is your taste of
          humor. Enjoy ü§ì

        <p>In case you reaaaaally need your code to work:</p>

        <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <code>
            üôèüèª [2021-11-09] {">"} git commit --amen // git commit --amend
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          Suitable for when you did the mightiest code change of &apos;em all:
        </p>

        <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <code>
            üë∏üèª [2021-12-13] {">"} god push --force // git push --force
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>This is my favourite one and kind of made me publish this post:</p>

        <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <code>ü§Æ [2022-01-27] {">"} git vommit // git commit</code>
        </pre>

        <p>It took a while, but here is another one:</p>

        <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <code>üò≠ [2022-06-21] {">"} git sad // git add</code>
        </pre>

        <p>Aaaaand it happened again.. only working on hot stuff.</p>

        <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <code>üî• [2022-09-12] {">"} hot push -u // git push</code>
        </pre>

        <p>First pun in 2023 ü•Åü•Åü•Å</p>

        <pre className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <code>üëåüèª [2023-02-10] {">"} git logo // git log</code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          <strong>
            Some addition needed to follow why my head found that a nice pun:
          </strong>{" "}
          Add some proper emphasis and punctuation (<strong>git? logo!</strong>
          ), plus a bit of german knowledge: &quot;Na logo!&quot; is a phrase
          expressing your commitment about something, similar to &quot;Oh
          well!&quot;, &quot;Fair enough&quot; or &quot;So what&quot;. With the
          difference that &quot;Na logo!&quot; is positively framed, showing
          approval and sometimes shouted with thrill of ecstasy. Or is there a
          better choice for version control?! Doubt it. üòè
        </p>

        <p>There is more to come. Promise. ü§ûüèª</p>
