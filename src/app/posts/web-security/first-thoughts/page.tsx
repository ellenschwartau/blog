          The most recent official update was published in 2021. The data used
          consists of vulnerabilities found in applications, which were
          submitted by security vendors and consultancies, bug bounties (didn't
          know this term existed), and further.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Insecure Design</h3>
        <p>
          In contrast to an insecure implementation this category points to
          weaknesses or errors in how software is designed. A well-known example
          here is using "security" questions to allow you to reset your
          password. Nevertheless how safe the code is implemented, more than the
          person themselves could know its cat's name is Gerhard, thus the
          design itself is insecure.

          Software and Data Integrity Failures
        </h3>
        <p>
          Whenever you decide to include a library or external data in your
          application, the authenticity needs to be checked, meaning they are
          genuine and unaltered. This task should not only be performed at the
          moment you integrate them the first time, but also when updates are
          applied.

          Server-Side Request Forgery
        </h3>
        <p>
          If your application provides users with the functionality to input and
          fetch a URL, this offers opportunities for attacks. For instance, an
          attacker could create a URL such as{" "}
          <code className="bg-gray-100 p-1 rounded not-prose">
            file:///etc/passwd

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Conclusion for today</h2>
        <p>
          The OWASP top 10 definitely doesn't provide a complete list of
          security vulnerabilities, but it does give a fairly up-to-date
          overview of what web developers should be aware of at the very least.
          Especially, I will take a closer look at the listed examples of
          attacks and the tools for prevention. No one can guarantee 100% secure
          applications, but understanding the commonly exploited vulnerabilities
          is a first step.
