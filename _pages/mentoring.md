I am offering **free 1:1 mentoring sessions for women and non-binaries** having a background **in** or heading for **IT**. The sessions happen in person (in case you live in Hamburg) or take place via a video call. You find more about [my professional background here](https://ellenschwartau.com/about/).

During mentoring we can discuss topics like career advice, public speaking, blog posts or podcasting and taking challenges of women in tech. We can also train for upcoming job interviews or check your CV. Always open for other topics as well.
