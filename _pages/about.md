## Technologist

Growing up in Hamburg I luckily ended up doing Software Development. Loved it since day 0 and am passionate about web technologies. By sharing my passion with you I hope to encourage people and other women in particular to take the step towards IT.

**I AM** curious | reliable | eager to learn | committed | hands-on | pragmatic | delivering high-quality work | supportive | a team player | autonomous | ambitious | determined | honest | funny | learning to be more patient with myself
